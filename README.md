# **Quadratics** : Simplify to Amplify

## Art in Every Pixel

**The Essence** : Quadratics redefines minimalism in the digital art space. Each piece is a geometrically inspired pixel, intentionally crafted to bring artistic purpose to the Bitcoin network.

**The Vision** : We bridge the gap between artistic simplicity and the technological innovation of Bitcoin, creating a unique aesthetic in the realm of digital art.

## Community Code

**Build on Bitcoin** : Quadratics is more than a collection; it's a call to action. We encourage our community to actively contribute and shape the Bitcoin ecosystem.

**Power in Numbers** : Inspired by the concept of quadratic funding, our community plays a crucial role. Together, we decide the direction and impact of Quadratics, emphasizing our collective voice and power.

## Back to Bitcoin Basics

**On Bitcoin, Through PIPE** : Our collection leverages the PIPE protocol, ensuring seamless and straightforward NFT transactions on the Bitcoin network.

**401 Promise** : At the core of Quadratics are four fundamental pillars: Art, Unity, Build, and Growth. These guide our mission and our community's journey in the Bitcoin space.

## Join the Grid

**Bit by Bit** : Each Quadratic secured by a community member not only adds to the collection but strengthens the entire Bitcoin community.

**Community Command** : We are a collective that cherishes each square in our grid, recognizing the value and importance of every member.

## The Square Root

**Keep It Squared** : In a world where complexity is often overrated, QUADRATICS brings you back to the basics. Our collection celebrates the inherent beauty and simplicity of fundamental shapes.
